# pico-totp

A TOTP generator using Raspberry Pi Pico. 

## Use Case

This project is a TOTP generator using the Raspberry Pi Pico, intended for educational purposes. It is designed to help the developer learn and practice embedded systems programming and TOTP algorithm implementation. The project is not intended for productive use, and many aspects are not fully implemented. No special attention is given to the secure storage of keys. It should be considered as a proof of concept.

## Hardware Setup

In addition to the Raspberry Pi Pico, a 2x16 character LCD with an HD44780 controller and a DS1307 real-time clock are used. The LCD is controlled via a 4-bit interface using a custom-developed PIO program. The real-time clock is connected via I2C.

## Build Environment

The project was set up using Visual Studio Code and the official Raspberry Pi Pico extension in a Fedora 40 container (via Distrobox). Specific adjustments were made for debugging, which are not further detailed here. A Segger J-Link Debugger was used with an external GDB binary (see launch.json).
